# Python Task Submission
# Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python


This repository contains two Python programs that perform basic tasks using user input.

##  Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
### Problem Statement:  

Write a Python program that:
    1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
    2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
    3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

## Explanaition 

This program prompts the user to enter a number, then calculates the factorial of that number using a recursive function called factorial. The function multiplies the number by the factorial of the previous number until it reaches 1. Finally, it prints the result.

## Expected Output
Example output if the user enters `5`:

```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is : 120
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Task1_Calculate_Factorial_Using_a_Function.py
   ```

## File Included
- `Task1_Calculate_Factorial_Using_a_Function.py` – Code to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function.






# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a number as input from the user.
2. Calculates and displays the following using the `math` module:
   - Square root of the number
   - Logarithm (base 2) of the number
   - Sine of the number

## Explanation
This program uses Python's built-in `math` module to perform various mathematical calculations. It prompts the user for a number, then computes and prints the square root, logarithm base 2, and sine of the entered number.

## Expected Output
Example output if the user enters `25`:

```
Enter a number: 25
Square Root  5.0
Logarithmic Root  4.643856189774724
Sine :  0.13235175009777303
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Task2_Using_the_Math_Module_for_Calculations.py
   ```

## File Included
- `Task2_Using_the_Math_Module_for_Calculations.py` – Code to perform calculations using the math module.
