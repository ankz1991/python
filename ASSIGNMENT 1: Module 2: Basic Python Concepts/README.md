# Python Task Submission

This repository contains two Python programs that perform basic tasks using user input.

##  Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

###  Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes **two numbers** as input from the user.
2. Performs the following **basic mathematical operations**:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the result of each operation clearly.

### Expected Output:
Example output (if input numbers are 10 and 2):

/usr/local/bin/python3.13 /Users/ak/PycharmProjects/python/Task1_PerformBasicMathematicalOperations.py 
Enter the First Number : 10
Enter the Second Number : 2
Addition :  12
Substraction :  8
Multiplication :  20
Division :  5.0

Process finished with exit code 0

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a user's **first name** and **last name** as input.
2. Concatenates them into a **full name**.
3. Prints a **personalized greeting message** using the full name.

###  Expected Output:
If the user inputs `Ankur` and `Kumar`, the program should output:

/usr/local/bin/python3.13 /Users/ak/PycharmProjects/python/Task2_Create_a_Personalized_Greeting.py 
Enter First Name : Ankur
Enter Last Name : Kumar
Hello,Ankur Kumar! Welcome to the Python Program
