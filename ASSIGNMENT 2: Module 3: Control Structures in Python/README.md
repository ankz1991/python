# Python Task Submission
# Module 3: Control Structures in Python


This repository contains two Python programs that perform basic tasks using user input.

##  Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
### Problem Statement:  

Write a Python program that:
      1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
      2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
      3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

## Explanaition 

This program asks the user to enter a number. It then checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

## Expected Output
/usr/local/bin/python3.13 /Users/ak/PycharmProjects/python/ASSIGNMENT 2/Task1_Check_if_a_Number_is_Even_or_Odd.py 
```
Enter a Number : 34
34 is an Even Number
```

/usr/local/bin/python3.13 /Users/ak/PycharmProjects/python/ASSIGNMENT 2/Task1_Check_if_a_Number_is_Even_or_Odd.py 

```
Enter a Number : 11
11 is an Odd Number
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Task1_Check_if_a_Number_is_Even_or_Odd.py
   ```

## File Included
- `Task1_Check_if_a_Number_is_Even_or_Odd.py` – Code to check if a number is even or odd.







# Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a **for loop** to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.
2. Displays the final sum.

## Explanaition 
The program in Task2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. It iterates through each number in the range, adds it to a running total, and then prints the final sum.


## Expected Output
The program should output:

```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is : 1275
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Task2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py
   ```

## File Included
- `Task2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py` – Code to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.



##  Files Included:
- `Task1_Check_if_a_Number_is_Even_or_Odd.py` – Code to check if a number is even or odd.
- `Task2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py` – Code to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.
